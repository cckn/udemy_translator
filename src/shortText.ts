Now in the last lesson, we created a brand new Material App, which is going to be the basis for all the

other widgets that we're going to construct on-screen. And by including the Material App,

we also get to tap into all of the components or widgets that the Material apps come with, such as a

text or an image widget.

But in this lesson, we're going to look at creating a scaffold in this Material app, so that we can have

an app bar, we can have a body where most of our app is going to go, or we can have a floating button if

we wanted to.`
